We developed two novel solutions, the first being pruning/quantum knitting and the second being a novel solution we designed using convolutions, which scaled the qubits by quantum adders instead of a large PDF encoding circuit.",

Then we utilized the Mixpeek API, downloading research papers as PDFs to the MongoDB Atlas Vector Database. We integrate Nomic-AI's embeddings, providing insights into their content and significance. Finally we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to create research clusters visualizations, helping users explore connections and trends.",
